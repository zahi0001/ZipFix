# ZipFix

## Overview
This web application is designed to connect individuals or businesses with workers available for hire. Much like Uber connects riders with drivers, this platform connects hirers with workers. Whether you need someone to mow your lawn, fix your plumbing, or help with a project, this app facilitates the process.

## Features
Worker Profiles: Workers can create profiles showcasing their skills, experience, and availability.
Job Posting: Hirers can post jobs specifying the task, location, and desired qualifications.

Matching Algorithm: The app matches hirers with suitable workers based on their requirements and availability.

Booking and Scheduling: Once a match is made, hirers can book workers and schedule appointments directly through the app.

Rating and Reviews: Both hirers and workers can rate and review each other based on their experience, ensuring accountability and trust within the community.

## Technologies Used

Frontend: Kotlin, XML through Android Studio

Backend: Kotlin, Parse Platform (through Back4App)

Version Control: Git, GitHub
